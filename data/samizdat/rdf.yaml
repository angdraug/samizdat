# Mapping of internal RDF properties to tables and fields. Statements
# over properties not listed here or in 'subproperty:' section below are
# reified using standard rdf::subject, rdf::predicate, and rdf::object
# properties, so at least these three and s::id must be mapped.
#
map:
  's::id': {resource: id}
  'dc::date': {resource: published_date}
  'dct::isPartOf': {resource: part_of}
  's::isPartOfSubProperty': {resource: part_of_subproperty}
  's::partSequenceNumber': {resource: part_sequence_number}

  'rdf::subject': {statement: subject}
  'rdf::predicate': {statement: predicate}
  'rdf::object': {statement: object}

  's::login': {member: login}
  's::fullName': {member: full_name}
  's::email': {member: email}

  'dc::title': {message: title}

# Map of properties into lists of their subproperties. For each property
# listed here, an additional qualifier field named <field>_subproperty
# is defined in the same table (as defined under 'map:' above) referring
# to resource id identifying the subproperty (normally a uriref resource
# holding uriref of the subproperty). Only one level of subproperty
# relation is supported, all subsubproperties must be listed directly
# under root property.
#
subproperties:
  'dct::isPartOf': [ 's::inReplyTo', 'dct::isVersionOf',
  's::isTranslationOf', 's::subTagOf' ]

# Map of transitive RDF properties into tables that hold their
# transitive closures. The format of the table is as follows: 'resource'
# field refers to the subject resource id, property field (and qualifier
# field in case of subproperty) has the same name as in the main table
# (as defined under 'map:' above) and holds reference to predicate
# object, and 'distance' field holds the distance from subject to object
# in the RDF graph.
#
transitive_closure:
  'dct::isPartOf': part
