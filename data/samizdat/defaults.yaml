# defaults.yaml
#
# Settings that can be shared between Samizdat sites

# Object Cache
#
# Location of a SynCache object cache, change this if you have your
# cache on a different machine or answering on a non-standard port. It
# is safe to have one object cache for several sites, as long as site
# names remain unique.
#
cache: 'druby://localhost:9000'

# Remote cache must be allowed to call back to the application process.
# If you move your cache away from localhost to a separate cache server,
# update this parameter to tell your application to bind DRuby to a URI
# that is accessible from the cache server.
#
cache_callback: 'druby://localhost:0'

# Template Paths
#
# List of paths where templates can be found. Paths are examined in the
# specified order: to change only some parts of Samizdat layout, you
# only have to put modified templates in your directory and prepend it
# to this list. You can also specify such new list of template paths in
# site-specific configuration which will override global Samizdat
# defaults only for that site.
#
templates:
  - '/usr/share/samizdat/templates/'
  - '/usr/local/share/samizdat/templates/'

# Email Interface
#
# This section defines parameters of email notifications generated by
# Samizdat. Uncomment this section to enable email interface, it is
# needed for verification of email addresses and password recovery.
#
#email:
#
#  # Email address for the From: field of Samizdat emails. Ideally, this
#  # should be a valid address on the same host as the web server (so
#  # that it isn't filtered out as spam), emails to that address should
#  # be forwarded to administrators of the site.
#  #
#  address: 'root@localhost'
#
#  # Program with Sendmail command-line interface that can be used to
#  # send outgoing mails.
#  #
#  sendmail: '/usr/sbin/sendmail'

# Language Settings
#
locale:

  # If you can't put .mo files in a proper place where it can be found
  # by GetText facility, specify a custom path here. Specify a full
  # path that doesn't depend on the working directory of CGI scripts.
  #
  #path: '../locale'   # 

  # List of languages supported by the site. First language in this list
  # is used as default for users who don't have language selection
  # configured in their browsers. The list can include languages for
  # which there's no corresponding .mo file, such languages will not be
  # available in UI language selection, but will be included in the
  # message language selection list in advanced message publishing
  # interface.
  #
  languages: [ en, be, de, eo, es, fr, ja, pl, ru, uk ]

  # If set to 'yes', list of languages on the front page will be sorted
  # alphabetically. If set to 'no' or unset, the list will be dispayed
  # in the specified order.
  # 
  sort_languages: no

  # Set to 'yes' to allow users to limit the frontpage to only messages
  # in their single preferred language.
  #
  allow_monolanguage: no

# CSS Themes
#
# List of CSS themes, each theme there should have a corresponding .css
# file in the css/ directory.
#
# Even though one of the themes has the name 'default', this does not
# have to be the default style. Whatever is the first theme in the list
# will be used as the default theme.
#
style: [ default, indy, savannah, sky ]

# Engine Parameters
#
# The timeout, limit, format, and file_extension sections below tune
# different parameters of the Samizdat engine. You don't need to mess
# with most defaults, the only exception can be limit:features_threshold
# parameter, which might need to be adjusted for high-traffic sites.
