Samizdat: Co-op Engine
======================

Mission Statement
-----------------

Samizdat is a generic RDF-based engine for building collaboration and
open publishing web sites. Samizdat provides users with means to
cooperate and coordinate on all kinds of activities, including media
activism, resource sharing, education and research, advocacy, and so on.
Samizdat intends to promote values of freedom, openness, equality, and
cooperation.

Samizdat users can publish, view, comment, edit, and aggregate text and
multimedia resources, vote on site structure and resource
classifications, filter resources by flexible sets of criteria (see
Features below, and Design Goals document). 

Samizdat builds its underlying data model on RDF (Resource Description
Framework), and defines a schema of resource classes and properties for
core concepts of a Samizdat site: member, message, thread, tag,
proposition, vote, version, part, and so on (see Concepts document).
Open nature of RDF allows to add new metadata and new uses of site
resources without effort, and to transparently interoperate with diverse
set of applications supporting this standard.

Samizdat project was inspired by Matthew Arnison's Open Publishing
initiative and Active engine used by the IndyMedia.org project, and by
rusty's Scoop engine used by Kuro5hin.org and other sites (see
References document). Unlike other open editing systems, it uses RDF
model from the ground up and targets other domains beyond publishing,
such as cooperation, education, and resource sharing.

Samizdat is free software and is built using free software, such as Ruby
programming language and PostgreSQL relational database management
system. All Samizdat source code and documentation can be redistributed
and/or modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
published by Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the license,
or (at your option) any later version.
